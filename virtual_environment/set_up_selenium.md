# Requirements:
- Visual Studio
- venv (virtual environment)

# How to Install Selenium and Set Up Browser?
1. within the terminal (of virtual environment) type *pip install selenium*
2. set up browser (ex. Chrome)
    - on Chrome, search for 'chromedriver' and download it by matching your current Chrome version
    - once unzipped downloaded file, you will see chromedriver.exe
    - thanks to this drvier, we will be able to run and operate within Selenium
3. move chromedriver to the selenium folder within Visual Studio

# Testing Tip
- if running code in selenium does not work, ensure that Interpretor in Visual Studio is correctly set
- Instead of Python 3... we should select Pytyon ..('selenium':venv)

THE END
