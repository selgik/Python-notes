# How to download/open jupyter notebook
1. Download from Anaconda
2. Click Jupyter Notebook -> program will be launched at Chrome (recommended browser)
3. Click new -> Python 3

# What do you call it?
1. cell: a line within the jupyter notebook.
         blue colour means it's on order mode, green colour means it's on edit mode
2. In [1] , In [2] ...: Input [1], Input [2]. Number incidates the order of execution.

# How to test
1. Click on cell and write code. 
2. Click Run button (or use shortcuts)
3. Result will appear below the cell.

# Shortcuts
1. Cntr + Enter: run current cell
2. Shift + Enter: run current cell and select next cell. 
   if no next cell exists, it will be created. 
3. Alt + Enter: run current cell and create next cell. 
4. DD: delete cell 
5. II: interrupt run (stop execution)
6. Cntr+S: save
7. Kernel - Restart & Run All: restart and re-number all cells ASC.

# Using modules
1. If you want to check which functions modules provide, use tab
   ex) import random
       random. <-- use Tab key and functions will appear
       
# Ask about functions
1. If you want to know more about the function, add ?
   ex) random.randint?
   result) summary of code explanation will appear
2. If you want to check source code as well, add ??
   ex) random.randint??

# What's the benefit of using Jupyter?
1. You can use Markdown: # for title, > for insert etc.
2. Write and run code on cell by cell
3. Real time view of graph/table
4. Save file as html or pdf.
   --> say you saved file in html. You can share codes/results to those who do not use Jupyter.
 
# Markdown cheetsheet
1. ESC - M to change from code mode to markdownmode: in such case, In[n] will be gone.
2. when you write a list, use 1. and the 1. not 1. 2. 3... 
   by doing this, you won't have to change number list after editing/removing item from the list.
   it will be auto-numbered.

# Where is my Jupyter file/folder?
1. C drive - Users - myname 
   - Folder: PythonDataWorkspace 
         - Pandas: for data analysis
         - Matplotlib: for data vizualization
         - Project: for project
2. Share .ipynb file so that others can test code chunks too.
