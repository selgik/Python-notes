<!-- 
1. BASIC OF HTML 
SAMPLE HTML STRUCTURE 
-->
<html>    
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title> 샘플 홈페이지 </title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <input type="text" value="Input Your ID">.
    <input type="password">
    <input type="button" value="Log In">
    <a href="https://google.com"> Go To Google </a>
  </body>
</html>
<!-- 
Explanation:
  <head>: element
  <input type="password">: in this element, we have tag name "input" and attribute "type"
Result: we have web-page with the title "샘플 홈페이지"
  And there are two input boxes as text(ID), password; also a button with label "Log In" and hyperlink to Google

2. XPATH 
2-1. TO BETTER UNDERSTAND XPATH, LET'S THINK ABOUT A SCHOOL AS IN A HTML STRUCTURE 
-->
<school name="Sylvia's Magic School">
  <grade value="1st grade">
    <class value="class A">
      <student value="no1"> Adam A </student>
      <student value="no2"> Damian D </student>
      <student value="no3"> Maciek M </student>
      <student value="no4"> Adam A </student>
    </class>
  </grade>
  <grde value="2nd grade">
    <class value="class A">
      <student value="no1"> Michal M </student>
    </class>
  </grade>
  <grde value="3rd grade"/>
</school>
<!-- 
Explanation:
  parent-child relationship: <school> is parnet and <grade> tag is child 
  sibling relationship: <student> are sibligns
-->

<!--
2-2. SEARCHING FOR SPECIFIC CONTENTS IN HTML
  In order to search for Damian D, we have to go down from school > 1st grade > class A > student 
  Xpath is path to find specific element or attribute. (According to W3Schools: syntax to identify and navigate nodes in an XML document) 
  In order to apply action (especially for web-scrapping), we need to know exact address
-->
/school/grade/class/student[2] 
/html/body/div/div/div/span/a...

<!-- 
2-3. HOW CAN WE SIMPLIFY PATH?
  If need to search for Adam A, we will be confused which Adam is needed. no1 Adam or no4 Adam? 
  For such case, giving unique code could help to find exact person in need, and xpath can be simplified 
-->
      <student value="no1" code="1-1-1-"> Adam A </student>
      <student value="no2" code="1-1-2-"> Damian D </student>
      <student value="no3" code="1-1-3-"> Maciek M </student>
      <student value="no4" code="1-1-4-"> Adam A </student>
<!-- 
Simplified:
  From: /school/grade/class/student[2] 
  To: //*[code="1-1-4"]
Explanation:
  / means: one layer below 
  // means: every lader (nodes) below
  @ means: attribute 
-->

<!-- 
2-4. GETTING XPATH FROM WEB SITE
  Example web site: https://www.w3schools.com/html/
  Scenario: I want ot get XPATH to HTML tab
  How to: Go to "HTML" tab on the page > right click > inspect > you will see highlighted section > right click > copy > copy Xpath
-->
//*[@id="topnav"]/div/div[1]/a[3]
